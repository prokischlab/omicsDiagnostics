In the absence of the CCC complex or its recruitment to endosomes, ATP7A is mislocalized and does not traffic in response to copper availability, resulting in altered copper handling.","All 10 human COMMD family members coprecipitated endogenous CCDC93. The interaction experiments validated the notion that these factors form a multiprotein complex. COMMD1 is directly linked to early endosomes through its interaction with a protein complex containing CCDC22, CCDC93, and C16orf62. This COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex interacts with the multisubunit WASH complex, an evolutionarily conserved system, which is required for endosomal deposition of F-actin and cargo trafficking in conjunction with the retromer. Interactions between the WASH complex subunit FAM21, and the carboxyl-terminal ends of CCDC22 and CCDC93 are responsible for CCC complex recruitment to endosomes.

CaN is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, which inhibit CaN after forming complexes with cytoplasmic binding proteins (cyclophilin and FKBP12, respectively). In the native CaN structure, an auto-inhibitory element binds at the Zn/Fe-containing active site. The metal-site geometry and active-site water structure suggest a catalytic mechanism involving nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphate by a metal-activated water molecule. In the FKBP12-FK506-CaN complex, the auto-inhibitory element is displaced from the active site. The site of binding of FKBP12-FK506 appears to be shared by other non-competitive inhibitors of calcineurin, including a natural anchoring protein.

Along with the enhanced chylomicrons, microsomes were characterized by abundant Sec12, the guanine exchange factor that promotes the localization of Sar1b in the endoplasmic reticulum. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed high levels of the complex components Sec23/Sec24 and p125, the Sec23-interacting protein.","During complex IV (= cytochrome C oxidase) assembly, imported subunits engage with mitochondria-encoded COX1 in assembly intermediates. The majority of imported complex IV subunits present N-terminal presequences and are transported by the presequence translocase. Progression of complex IV assembly requires nuclear-encoded subunits to utilize this import pathway: human TIM21 associates with the presequence translocase as well as MITRAC complexes in a dynamic manner. MITRAC12 associates with SURF1 and COX1 assembly intermediates and is required for efficient COX1 translation. Assembly of the early cytochrome c oxidase subunit COX4-1 requires TIM21, whereas it is dispensable forlate-assembling subunits. The finding that TIM21 also interacts with complex I intermediates points to a more general role of TIM21 in respiratory-chain assembly. Furthermore, TIM21 appears to be tightly connected to MITRAC15, which, in contrast to TIM23 and MITRAC12, coimmunoprecipitates with TIM21 under all tested conditions. MITRAC15 associates with MITRAC and is required for complex IV but also complex I assembly.","Ubiquitin E3 ligases covalently attach ubiquitin to a lysine residue on a target protein.

More than half of HSP cases result from autosomal dominant mutations in atlastin-1 (also known as SPG3A), receptor expression enhancing protein 1 (REEP1; SPG31), or spastin (SPG4). The atlastin-1 GTPase interacts with spastin, a microtubule-severing ATPase, as well as with the DP1/Yop1p and reticulon families of ER-shaping proteins, and SPG3A caused by atlastin-1 mutations has been linked pathogenically to abnormal ER morphology. Defects in tubular ER shaping and network interactions with the microtubule cytoskeleton seem to be the predominant pathogenic mechanism of HSP.","Besides CUL7, two additional genes, OBSL1 and CCDC8, have been foundto be mutated in 3M syndrome.

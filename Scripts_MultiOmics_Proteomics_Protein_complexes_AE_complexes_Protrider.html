Importin alpha binds the NLS, while importin beta mediates translocation through the nuclear pore complex. After translocation, RanGTP, whose predicted concentration is high in the nucleus and low in the cytoplasm, binds importin beta and displaces importin alpha. Importin alpha must then be returned to the cytoplasm, leaving the NLS protein behind. CAS protein mediates importin alpha re-export. CAS binds strongly to importin alpha only in the presence of RanGTP, forming an importin alpha/CAS/RanGTP complex. Importin alpha is released from this complex in the cytoplasm by the combined action of RanBP1 and RanGAP1. CAS binds preferentially to NLS-free importin alpha, hereby leaving import substrates back in the nucleus. CAS binding to importin alpha depends on RanGTP. It was shown that without further addition or with addition of wild-type RanGDP, importin beta bound efficiently to importin alpha, but CAS only weakly. The opposite pattern was observed when the permanently GTP-bound Ran mutants were added: importin beta binding was completely abolished, whereas the CAS binding to importin alpha was greatly enhanced.

In vitro, TBL1/TBLR1 bind histones H2B and H4, and, importantly, repression by TBL1/TBLR1 correlates with their interaction with histones.

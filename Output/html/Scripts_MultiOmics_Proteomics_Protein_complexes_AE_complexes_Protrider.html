Through mass spectrometry and Western blotting of mitochondrial complexes and density gradient ultracentrifugation, it was shown that that 3betaHSD2 formed a transient association with the translocases Tim50 and Tom22 and with Tim23. This association occurred primarily through the interaction of Tim50 with the N terminus of 3betaHSD2 and contributed to enzymatic activity.

Importin alpha binds the NLS, while importin beta mediates translocation through the nuclear pore complex. After translocation, RanGTP, whose predicted concentration is high in the nucleus and low in the cytoplasm, binds importin beta and displaces importin alpha. Importin alpha must then be returned to the cytoplasm, leaving the NLS protein behind. CAS protein mediates importin alpha re-export. CAS binds strongly to importin alpha only in the presence of RanGTP, forming an importin alpha/CAS/RanGTP complex. Importin alpha is released from this complex in the cytoplasm by the combined action of RanBP1 and RanGAP1. CAS binds preferentially to NLS-free importin alpha, hereby leaving import substrates back in the nucleus. CAS binding to importin alpha depends on RanGTP. It was shown that without further addition or with addition of wild-type RanGDP, importin beta bound efficiently to importin alpha, but CAS only weakly. The opposite pattern was observed when the permanently GTP-bound Ran mutants were added: importin beta binding was completely abolished, whereas the CAS binding to importin alpha was greatly enhanced. This suggested that the CAS/RanGTP complex is the high affinity form for importin alpha binding.","None","The authors show that upon tyrosine phosphorylation, LAT binds Grb2, PLC-gamma1, the p85 subunit of PI3K, and other critical signaling molecules.

Export depends upon the RNA cap structure, nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), the export receptor CRM1/Xpo1, and RanGTP. PHAX (phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export) is an additional factor required for U snRNA export complex assembly in vitro. In vivo, PHAX is required for U snRNA export but not for CRM1-mediated export in general. PHAX is phosphorylated in the nucleus and then exported with RNA to the cytoplasm, where it is dephosphorylated. PHAX phosphorylation is essential for export complex assembly while its dephosphorylation causes export complex disassembly. The compartmentalized PHAX phosphorylation cycle can contribute to the directionality of export.
